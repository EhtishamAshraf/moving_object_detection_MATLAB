# Car Detection in Video Using Background Subtraction and Optical Flow

This repository contains code for detecting moving cars in a video using two different approaches: **background subtraction** and **optical flow**. Each method is implemented in a separate script, and the results are saved as output videos.

## Overview

Detecting moving objects, particularly cars, in video sequences is a fundamental task in computer vision. This repository provides two methods to accomplish this task:
1. **Background Subtraction**: Identifies moving objects by comparing each frame of the video with a background model.
2. **Optical Flow**: Detects moving objects by estimating the motion of pixels between consecutive frames.
